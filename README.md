# Monir - The Code Enthusiast

## Who is Monir?
Monir is a self-proclaimed *coding legend* who dabbles in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and  React JS. With a growing interest in c and Python, he's on a never-ending journey to learn and build, even if it means hitting a few roadblocks along the way. His projects are always a "work in progress," but he somehow makes it look effortless (most of the time).

## Achievements
- **React JS Enthusiast:** Monir is diving headfirst into React, and though he's still figuring out hooks and state management, he's definitely getting the hang of it.
- **Flask & Python Lover:** Knows how to handle backend tasks, especially when it comes to scraping and working with web APIs.
- **Web Scraping with Playwright:** Monir's scraping skills are top-tier, though sometimes Playwright has other ideas.

## Skills
- **C Programming:** Adept at tackling C projects, although he prefers to focus on simple tasks that don’t break the system.
- **React JS:** In progress, but he’s already addicted to the flexibility it offers and the power of components.
- **JavaScript & HTML/CSS:** Knows the basics and is always experimenting with new features, trying to make things look "just right."
- **Python:** Comfortable with Python, especially when it comes to web scraping, backend tasks, and handling APIs.

### Fun Facts
- **Project Overload:** I have many unfinished projects, even my IDE starts questioning my life choices.
